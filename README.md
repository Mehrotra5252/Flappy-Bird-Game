# Flappy-Bird-Game
Code By Team Dusty
The code for a Flappy Bird game in JavaScript will create a game where the player controls a bird that must navigate through obstacles in the form of pipes. The bird can flap its wings to fly higher and avoid collision with the pipes. The objective is to get the highest score possible by successfully navigating through as many pipes as possible. The game will have a start screen, a game screen where the player controls the bird, and an end screen that displays the player's score. The code will be implemented using JavaScript and can include features such as score tracking, difficulty adjustment, and graphics. The watermark "Team Dusty" will be displayed on the game screen. This code is intended to provide a basic example of a JavaScript game and can be used as a starting point for further customization and development.
